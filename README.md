# âš¡ Future Energy

Bringing clean energy into Minecraft.

This mod introduces clean energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower into Minecraft. Players can continuously generate clean energy using devices like solar panels and wind turbines, transmit it through power lines, and utilize it for various purposes. With this energy, you can cook food and smelt ores faster using electric furnaces, and enjoy more convenient transportation with electric cars and aircraft. Waste products generated in the process can either be recycled with the help of energy or used to generate more power, ultimately achieving harmless disposal.
